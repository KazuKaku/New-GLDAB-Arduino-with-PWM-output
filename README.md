# New GLDAB by Arduino with convert PPM to PWM signal output

I've added code that converts PPM signals to PWM signals to the New GLDAB by Arduino.
This makes it possible to create a lightweight Ornithopter using a small ppm output receiver.

The preglide time (the time the motor continues to run after the throttle stick is at its lowest position) is 0.35 seconds. (For use with small Ornithopters)
The preglide time can be changed by changing the i value.
The preglide time is approximately 0.35 seconds for Line148"i<10000" and Line 180 and 183 "i=10000".
When increasing the preglide time, increase the i value.
For example, "i<12000" and "i=12000".

New GLDAB by Arduino modified to receive ppm signal from RX and output PWM signal.

This allows you to use a small 1g receiver without using a large RX.ã€€PWM output is 8ch.
